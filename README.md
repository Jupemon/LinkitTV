## Blog post

I wrote a blog post regarding this project : https://jupemon.blogspot.com/2020/02/steamer-and-audience-interaction-apps.html

## How it works

streamer opens up the linkittv website while they are streaming and create a 'session' on it. After that the app will create a suggestion link which can be shared with the streamers audience

## Suggestion link

Stream viewers can suggest youtube videos to the streamer throught this. Any video suggestions made can be viewed by the streamer.
